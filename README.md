### Highlight something in your project that you thought was especially interesting or significant to your overall implementation.
> Implementing mechanism for fetching token from the server and storing it in the local storage and then make request once again. 
> Proper display of the poster was also tricky, but gave a lot of fun. 

### Tell us what you are most pleased or proud of with your implementation.
> The code is small, but everything is working as expected. I wasn't asked for the design, but it was easy to implement it with the help of the tailwind. I used modern angular features like signals and control flow.

### Given more time, what next feature or improvement would you like to add to your project?
> Unit tests, more detailed error handling, maybe some kind of store like for example NgRx.
